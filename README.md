# java-json-koans
A collection of koans is an interactive way to learn a progamming language.
The lessons come in the form of actual code: No explaining text, only UnitTests that will all fail in the beginning.
You follow the path to enlightenment by making the tests pass one by one.

This project provides koans to learn how to use JSON in Java with the org.json library.

- Check out the project, build with Maven
- Run the project as a TestNG test suite
- GOAL: Make all the tests pass


Feel free to contact me, if you are stuck with a koan or if you have suggestions how to improve the project.
