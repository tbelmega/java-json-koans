# java-json-koans
A collection of koans is an interactive way to learn a progamming language.
The lessons come in the form of actual code: A suite of failing UnitTests.
You follow the path to enlightenment by making the tests pass one by one.
There is no lecture, no tutorial. Take it as a riddle: Figure out what to do on your own.  

This project provides koans to learn how to use JSON in Java with the org.json library.

- Check out the project, build with Maven
- Run the project as a TestNG test suite
- GOAL: Make all the tests pass


Feel free to contact me, if you are stuck with a koan or if you have suggestions how to improve the project.
